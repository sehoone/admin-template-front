# Why choose us?

::: info is written in front

We will not compare with other frameworks. We believe that each framework has its own characteristics and is suitable for different scenarios. Our goal is to provide a simple and easy-to-use framework so that developers can get started quickly and focus on the development of business logic. So we will only continue to improve and optimize our framework to provide a better experience.

:::

We are committed to providing developers with an efficient, modern, and easy-to-use front-end framework. Our solutions are based on the latest technology stacks such as Vue3, Vite and TypeScript, ensuring you are always on the cutting edge of technology when building your projects. At the same time, we focus on the quality and specification of the code and ensure the consistency and maintainability of the code through a strict tool chain. Whether it's a startup project or an enterprise-level application, our framework helps you build, iterate, and deploy quickly.

## Framework process

Starting with Vue Vben Admin version 1.x, the framework has gone through many iterations and optimizations. Starting with the `Vite 0.x` version, there were no ready-made plugins, and many custom plugins were developed to bridge the differences between Webpack and Vite. Although many of them have now been replaced, our original intention has never changed, which is to provide a simple and easy-to-use framework.

Although it was maintained by the community for a period of time, we have been paying close attention to the development of Vue Vben Admin. Witnessed many developers using Vben Admin and provided many valuable suggestions and feedback. Thank you very much for your support and contributions, which are the motivation for us to continue to improve Vben Admin. In the new version, we continue to collect user feedback, start over, and continuously optimize the framework to provide a better user experience. Our goal is to enable developers to get started quickly and focus on the development of business logic.

## Unit testing

Unit testing is the cornerstone of ensuring code quality. Write and execute unit tests during development to catch potential bugs and improve code reliability. The core logic of the framework is unit tested using `vitest`, and the coverage is gradually increased. Through unit testing, you can refactor code with confidence and reduce regression problems, thereby improving overall development efficiency.

## Quality and Standards

We always attach great importance to the quality and specification of code. Ensure code quality by using tools like ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, Publint, CSpell etc. Our code specifications are based on modern front-end technologies such as Vue3, Vite, TypeScript, etc., aiming to provide a concise and easy-to-use framework so that developers can get started quickly and focus on the development of business logic.
