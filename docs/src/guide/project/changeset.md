#Changeset

The project has built-in [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) as a version management tool. Changeset is a version management tool that can help us better manage versions, generate changelogs, and automatically publish.

Detailed usage can be found in the official documentation and will not be explained here. If you don't need it, just ignore it.

## Command line

The changeset command is already built into the project:

### Fill in the changeset interactively

```bash
pnpm run changeset
```

### Unified upgrade version number

```bash
pnpm run version
```
