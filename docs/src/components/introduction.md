::: info README

This document introduces the usage, properties, events, etc. of the framework components. If you feel that the encapsulation of existing components is not ideal enough, or does not fully meet your needs, you can directly use native components, or encapsulate a suitable component yourself. The components provided by the framework are not binding. Whether to use them or not depends entirely on your needs and freedom.
